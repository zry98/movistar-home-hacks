## Kiosk escaping

> [!CAUTION]
> Following the instructions below will certainly **void the warranty** of your device and **may violate your service agreement or contract** with Movistar. Proceed entirely at your own risk.

You don't need (and likely very difficult) to install Linux like with the model `IGW-5000A2BKMP-I v2`.

If your have a Movistar Wi-Fi with valid _Fusi√≥n_ contract, you can enter the main screen after connecting to it. Pull down the top panel and tap "Ajustes" to open the settings, then tap _Conectividad > Altavoz bluetooth_ to enter the menu originally meant for connecting to a Bluetooth speaker. But for some reason, it can also be used to connect a Bluetooth keyboard; if you don't have one, you can try using a virtual Bluetooth keyboard app on your Android phone. You can now skip the next section and go directly to the [configurations part](#configurations).

But if you don't have a Movistar Wi-Fi, you cannot skip the Wi-Fi connection screen and access the Bluetooth settings. You'll have to dissemble it and do some soldering. For dissembling, you can refer to [the section in IGW5000/README.en.md](../IGW5000/README.en.md#disassembling) as the chassis are identical.

### Connecting a USB keyboard

If yours has a `Rev4` (a known manufacturing date (YYMM): `2001`) PCB then you are very lucky that it comes with a female USB Type-C connector already soldered and functioning!

But unfortunately, the more common one on the market is `Rev5` (a known manufacturing date (YYMM): `2008`) which not only comes with the USB Type-C connector unpopulated, but also lacks a 5.1 kŒ© pull-down resistor between the `CC` (`CC1` or `CC2` depending on the side) and `GND` pins to put it in host mode. So you'll have to solder the resistor yourself like below:

![RG3205W-Rev5-USB-pull-down-resistor](../assets/img/RG3205W-Rev5-USB-pull-down-resistor.jpg)

![USB-Type-C-pinout](../assets/img/USB-Type-C-pinout.png)

The 4-pin white female JST-PH connector nearby is also connected to the USB 2.0 pins, with the pinout from left to right: `D-`, `D+`, `GND`, `+5V`, you can use it to lead out the USB connection without needing to solder a USB Type-C SMD connector (which is very difficult to do).

## Configurations

Anyway, with a USB or Bluetooth keyboard connected, you can press the keys <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> (<kbd>Super</kbd> is usually the <kbd>‚äû Win</kbd> key) to open the notification panel, then tap the gear icon to open the Android system settings.

### Rev4

If you got a Rev4 variant, you are so lucky that it doesn't have any restrictions in the ROM, so you can just enable the Developer options by tapping the build number 7 times, then enable USB debugging and do stuff via ADB.

### Rev5

Unfortunately, we still haven't found a way to enable USB debugging on the Rev5 variant, because the whole "Developer options" menu is removed from the ROM, along with many many other things.

However, you can still install APKs by using the built-in E-mail app. You can open that app by pressing the keys <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>, then configure an email account. After that, you can send an email to this address with the APK attached, then open the email in the app and tap the attachment to download and install it.

> [!TIP]
> You should not use major email providers like Gmail either for sending or receiving, because they normally do not allow APK attachments. You can use the "[email-file-server](https://github.com/zry98/movistar-home-hacks/tree/main/email-file-server)" tool provided in this repository, please check the [next subsection](#use-the-email-file-server-tool) for detailed instructions.

**For more information on hacks for the Rev5, please refer to [RG3205W/rev5_howto.en.md](../RG3205W/rev5_howto.en.md).**

First app you should definitely install is a [launcher](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=launcher), and set it as the default launcher (_Settings > Apps & notifications > Advanced > Default apps > Home app_), otherwise you'll still be stuck in the onboarding app every time it reboots.

But be aware that the onboarding app sometimes will disconnect the Wi-Fi and locks you out. So we still need to find a way to uninstall them.

#### Use the email-file-server tool

You should have a PC that is accessible from your Movistar Home, for example, in the same LAN.

Download the email-file-server release suitable for your PC from its [release page](https://github.com/zry98/movistar-home-hacks/releases/tag/v0.0.1), for example, `email-file-server_v0.0.1_windows_amd64.zip` for most Windows PC. Decompress the archive and open the decompressed folder.

Put the APK files you want to install on Movistar Home inside the `files` folder in the decompressed folder.

Open a terminal in the same folder, execute `./email-file-server`. By default, it will read all files inside `./files`, and start a minimal POP3 server listening on the 8110 port, and a minimal SMTP server listening on the 8025 port.

You can run `./email-file-server --help` to see its usage if you want to customize anything.

In the mail app on your Movistar Home, configure an account with any address, then click the button "AJUSTES MANUALES":

![email-apks-step-1](../assets/img/email-apks/step-1.png)

Select the "PERSONAL (POP3)" type of account.

Input any password, then click the button "SIGUIENTE".

Input the IP address of your PC running the server in the "SERVIDOR" field, select "Ninguna" as the "TIPO DE SEGURIDAD", and input the POP3 port (`8110` by default) in the "PUERTO" field. Then click "SIGUIENTE":

![email-apks-step-4](../assets/img/email-apks/step-4.png)

Input the same IP address in the "SERVIDOR SMTP" field, select "Ninguna" as the "TIPO DE SEGURIDAD", input the SMTP port (`8025` by default) in the "PUERTO" field, and uncheck the box "Solicitar inicio de sesi√≥n". Then click "SIGUIENTE":

![email-apks-step-5](../assets/img/email-apks/step-5.png)

Select "Nunca" as the "Frecuencia de sincronizaci√≥n", and click "SIGUIENTE".

You can give a name to the account but it's not necessary, just click "SIGUIENTE" and you should see the inbox. By default, it will start fetching all the mails (with APK attached, which can be huge), please wait for the loading spinner to finish. If you don't see anything, swipe down to force sync.

After you see the mail containing the APK you want, open it and click the attachment, then click any of the two buttons to install it:
